# About Me #
***
I am a second-year student of MSLU. I am 19 year-old person with enough time to study and doing something for my own. I like to learn something new. If I like some activity, I will give it a lot of time and effort. Six months ago, I started studying front-end and later heared about the RS School. I really liked this idea, bcs I like to write code and listen to music in the background. In the future, I want to cooperate with international companies related to programming. I know how to work both alone and in a company, I easily find a common language with most people.
Just do it!
